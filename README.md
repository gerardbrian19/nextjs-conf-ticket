## Challenging list

- implement the gradient borders.
- implement the half-circles right and left.

## More explanations

- if you understand Arabic here is a link for a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/BfAydRvM-vk) explaining the steps I took to implement that challenge,
- but if you don't understand Arabic don't worry here is a [blog post](https://medhatdawoud.net/blog/gradient-borders-with-curves-and-3d-animation-in-css) in English which should be helpful in understanding.
